# üöÄ Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges
<p style="text-align:justify;"> The co-evolution of brain and body empowers animals to exhibit complex behaviors in their environments. Motivated by this natural synergy, Embodied Co-Design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for the development of intelligent agents, including both physical robots and virtual creatures. In contrast to conventional approaches that primarily focus on control optimization, ECD jointly optimizes an agent's morphology and control, thereby enhancing environmental interactions and improving task performance compared to control design alone.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/cover4.jpg" width="99%"></div>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>üîë Contributions to Embodied AI:</b> This work provides a comprehensive survey of ECD within the broader landscape of embodied intelligence. We begin with definitions of ECD and contextualize it within related fields such as evolutionary robotics, artificial life, and computational robot design. Next, we introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy to classify design spaces and representation methods for control, morphology, and tasks, which allows us to analyze over one hundred recent studies in ECD. We review notable benchmarks and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions.

We hope that this survey can serve as a reference-worthy and stimulating contribution to the advancement of embodied intelligence while also providing valuable perspectives for related fields.</p></b>

## Taxonomy of Embodied Co-Design
<p style="text-align:justify;"> 

The creation of an embodied agent hinges on three critical components: <b>Controlling Brain</b>, <b>Body Morphology</b>, <b>Task Environment</b>, and the <b>Co-Design</b> algorithm that optimizes these components.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Controlling Brain</b>: The controller (software) is responsible for perception-action coupling, enabling an agent to process sensory information and generate appropriate motor responses to control its body.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Body Morphology</b>: The physical embodiment (hardware) of an agent, including its shape, material properties, sensor placement, etc. Morphological design determines the agent‚Äôs physical capabilities and constraints, thereby impacting its performance and adaptability.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Task Environment</b>: This includes both task-specific conditions and broader environmental configurations. It not only defines the challenge faced by an agent but also provides the necessary feedback for learning and adaptation. Task requirements and environmental dynamics are crucial for shaping the agent‚Äôs behavior and learning objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. Co-Design Algorithms (A machine that can design other machines)</b>: An effective co-design algorithm integrates the optimization of control, morphology, and environmental interactions. Unlike traditional methods that treat these components separately, co-design algorithms aim to simultaneously refine all aspects, leading to more efficient and adaptive agents. These algorithms leverage advanced techniques to explore and exploit the co-design space, optimizing for performance across diverse tasks and environments.</p>
