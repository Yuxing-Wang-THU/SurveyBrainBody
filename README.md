# üöÄ Brain-Body Co-Design for Embodied Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Human bodies have been carefully refined through the long process of evolution, enabling us to utilize our bodies to solve a multitude of tasks skillfully. This capability, natural to humans, remains challenging for embodied agents, such as robots. The difficulty arises because successful interactions are highly dependent on the synergy between brain, body, and environment. Recent breakthroughs in vision, language, and robotics have significantly improved the sensorimotor learning capabilities of embodied agents. Alongside the great potential of sensorimotor learning for understanding the world, the concept of <b>Brain-Body Co-Design (BBCD), namely, Automated Agent Design</b> has attracted considerable cross-disciplinary attention. Unlike traditional agent design approaches, which focus primarily on optimizing an agent‚Äôs control mechanism ("brain") while keeping its morphological structure ("body") and task configurations ("environment") fixed, BBCD emphasizes their simultaneous coordination, to design embodied agents that are not only structurally sound but also behaviorally adept.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/cover4.jpg" width="99%"></div>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>üîë Contributions to Embodied AI:</b> This paper surveys recent advancements in BBCD within the context of embodied intelligence. We introduce a novel taxonomy that provides a structured analysis of the representations, co-design spaces, and optimization frameworks employed in state-of-the-art BBCD methods. We review notable benchmarks and applications of BBCD in simulated and real-world environments. We identify significant open challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions.

 We hope that this survey can serve as a reference-worthy and stimulating contribution to the advancement of embodied intelligence while also providing valuable perspectives for related fields.</p></b>

## Taxonomy of BBCD
<p style="text-align:justify;"> 

The creation of an embodied agent hinges on three critical components: <b>Brain (control)</b>, <b>Body (morphology)</b>, <b>Environment (task)</b>, and the <b>co-design algorithm (optimization)</b> that optimizes these components.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Brain (Control)</b>: The controller (software) is responsible for perception-action coupling, enabling an agent to process sensory information and generate appropriate motor responses to control its body.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Body (Morphology)</b>: The physical embodiment (hardware) of an agent, including its shape, material properties, sensor placement, etc. Morphological design determines the agent‚Äôs physical capabilities and constraints, thereby impacting its performance and adaptability.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Environment (Interaction constraints)</b>: This includes both task-specific conditions and broader environmental configurations. It not only defines the challenge faced by an agent but also provides the necessary feedback for learning and adaptation. Task requirements and environmental dynamics are crucial for shaping the agent‚Äôs behavior and learning objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. Co-Design Algorithm (A machine that can design other machines)</b>: An effective co-design algorithm integrates the optimization of control, morphology, and environmental interactions. Unlike traditional methods that treat these components separately, co-design algorithms aim to simultaneously refine all aspects, leading to more efficient and adaptive agents. These algorithms leverage advanced techniques to explore and exploit the co-design space, optimizing for performance across diverse tasks and environments.</p>
